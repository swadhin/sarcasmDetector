SASI_annotatedDataStandardRelease.xls contains the gold standard data we used for the human evaluation in both papers:
[*] ICWSM - A Great Catchy Name: Semi-Supervised Recognition of Sarcastic Sentences in Product Reviews, Oren Tsur, Dmitry Davidov and Ari Rappoport. Proceeding of AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media - ICWSM-10, 2010, 
and 
[**] Semi-Supervised Recognition of Sarcastic Sentences in Twitter and Amazon, Dmitry Davidov*, Oren Tsur* and Ari Rappoport. Proceeding of Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), 2010

The file contain two sheets, one for the Amazon data (used in paper [*]) and one for the twitter data (used in paper [**]). 
Each sheet has 5 titled colomns: Sentence, MT1, MT2, MT3 and SASI. The Sentence col contains the sentence itself, MT1-3 are the mechanichal turk annotations for each sentence and SASI presents the SASI sarcasm score. 

Note that the 1-5 scale was collapsed to a binary classification. See papers for discussion of the evaluation method and the way the mapping was done. 

Citation of the appropriate paper will be appreciated. That is, if you use the Amazon data please cite paper [*] and if you use the Twitter data please cite paper [**]
